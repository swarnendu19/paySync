# PaySync

PaySync is a robust TypeScript library designed to offer a unified interface for seamless integration with multiple payment providers, including Stripe, LemonSqueezy, RozerPay and others. By using PaySync, developers can effortlessly switch between different payment gateways without the need to overhaul their existing payment logic. This simplifies the process of managing diverse payment systems, providing flexibility and scalability while maintaining a consistent and efficient codebase.

## Features

- **PaySync API:** A unified interface to interact seamlessly with multiple payment providers through a single class..
- **Provider Agnostic:** Switch between different payment providers with minimal code changes.
- **Easy Integration:** Simplifies the integration process with well-documented methods and examples.
- **Extensible:** Easily extendable to accommodate new payment providers, ensuring scalability and future-proofing the system.

## Providers

- **Stripe:** (Checkout, Webhook).
- **RazorPay:** (comming soon).

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install paysync
```

## Usage

```typescript
// Stripe
const stripe = new PaySync.Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);

//This is just an Example data
const checkoutDetails = {
  payment_method_types: ["card"],
  line_items: [{ price: "price_1HjHdV2eZvKYlo2CtLzk2uIX", quantity: 1 }],
  mode: "payment",
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  cancel_url: "https://example.com/cancel",
};

const checkoutUrl = await stripe.generatePaymentURL(checkoutDetails);
```

## Webhook

```typescript
// Stripe
const stripe = new PaySync.Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);

const signatureHeader = context.req.header("Stripe-Signature");
if (!signatureHeader) throw new Error("No Signature");

const webhookPayload = {
  signatureHeader: signatureHeader,
  webhookSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
  requestBody: await context.req.text(),
};

const webhookEvent = await stripe.validateWebhookSignature(webhookPayload);

if ("error" in webhookEvent) throw new Error(webhookEvent.error.message);

switch (webhookEvent.event.type) {
  case "checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded":
    // Handle successful payment
    break;

  default:
    // Handle other event types if needed
    break;
}
```
